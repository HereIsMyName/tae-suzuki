    <h2>Artist Statement</h2> 
    <p> 
      I am a multi-disciplinary artist working in media that include drawing, woodcutting, printmaking, collage and installation. The concepts of my creation are often inspired by specific places 
      I’ve been to and the traditional folklores, superstition, handcrafts, local history and personal stories of the people I’ve met during my travel. Some of my works include interactive elements which 
      creates a level of immersion to help the audience connect to the art-piece more effectively. 
      <br /> 
      <br /> 
      My primary goal is to help people connect with society and their surroundings through creative engagement. I 
      believe in the importance of cultivating an interest in the arts and spreading awareness of art to as many people as possible. This is my mission, my passion and my dream.
